### Building

### Usage

* See the ['api' package](java/squeek/applecore/api); most things are handled by Forge events
* See the ['example' package](java/squeek/applecore/example), which implements a Forge mod that uses the AppleCore API to make various test modifications
* Use the [Maven repository](http://www.ryanliptak.com/maven) to automatically include AppleCore in your build environment or grab the API artifact from [drone.io](https://drone.io/github.com/squeek502/AppleCore/files)
