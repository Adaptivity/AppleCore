Project Log/Notes:
 - Modifying food eating duration using the Forge event PlayerUseItemEvent.Start does not produce clean visuals; it just adds a delay to the start of the animation. The solution should be player-specific, which isn't possible by only hooking into ItemFood. @date(2014-07-24 01:45)
